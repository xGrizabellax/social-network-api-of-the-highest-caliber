  ## Installation:
  MongoDB and Mongoose are both necessary to use this. Also a REST client such as Insomnia or Postman to test the routes, as there is no front-end to represent data.

  ## Usage:
  For socializing with your community and leaving positive feedback for other users and friends.

  ## Contributing:
  N / A

  ## Tests:
  Make sure to type in the correct routes found in the "routes" directory if you would like to try it out yourself!
